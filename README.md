# CYS223 SQL Injection Demo

This project uses React, Flask, and MariaDB to showcase how SQL injection can be used and how to prevent against it. 
This was designed and showcased as a CYS223, Cybersecurity Principles and Foundations, final project

PLEASE NOTE: This is only a single piece of a greater presentation! 

## Front-End Implementation
The visual design is implemented by utilizing React. There are no packages or imported elements to help the implementation of React.
There are two different main pages, insec.jsx and sec.jsx, with each representing a form vulnerable to SQL injection and one that isn't.

## Back-End Implementation
The back-end scripting is implemented by utilizing Python through Flask. Why? I just wanted to do something new.
The Database used in this proejct is MariaDB. It's hosted locally and only works on localhost. Sorry to the nobody who's looking at pulling this project.
